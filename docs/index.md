## Quick Start

```python
from py_cashier import cache

# Simple function caching
@cache()
def expensive_calculation(x: int, y: int) -> int:
    print(f"Calculating {x} + {y}")
    return x + y

# First call performs the calculation
result1 = expensive_calculation(1, 2)  # Output: Calculating 1 + 2
print(result1)  # Output: 3

# Second call uses cached result
result2 = expensive_calculation(1, 2)  # No calculation performed
print(result2)  # Output: 3
```
